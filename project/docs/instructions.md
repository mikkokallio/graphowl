# User instructions

## Getting started

Using the dashboard is easy: when you start up the app, the app loads a dashboard and shows it. The app comes with a demo dashboard, so you don't have to do anything else to enjoy spectacular-looking graphs. But of course, you may want to configure a dashboard of your own.

## Configuring a dashboard

See the instructions below on how to make changes to an existing dashboard, or create a wholly new dashboard altogether.

### Adjusting layout

1. Click the **cog** symbol on the left. A config view opens.
2. Change the x and y dimensions to e.g. 2 and 2.
3. Change the title and timespan if you like.
4. Click **save**.
5. Click the **owl** symbol on the left. The dashboard reloads and shows the new layout and other changes.

### Creating new graphs

Creating new graphs is quite error-prone. It is strongly recommended to use an existing graph and then make small changes rather than trying to build from scratch.

1. Click the **graph** icon on the left. Graph configuration view opens.
2. Use the `<` and `>` buttons to find the graph *after* which you'd like to place the new graph.
**Note:** The graphs are laid out in the dashboard view left-right and top-down. So if you are using a 2x2 layout, the first two graphs in order will be on top, and the other two will be below. If you have 5 graphs in a 2x2 layout, the fifth one won't be shown until you change the layout. Conversely, if you have only 3 graphs in a 2x2 layout, the bottom-right one will be empty.
3. Fill in all the fields in the new graph. If you don't know what you're doing (very likely!), use existing graphs from the demo as examples and try changing only small things first.
4. Click **save** and go back to the dashboard view to see if it works. If you get an error, view the message and then your configuration again, and try to figure out what part of the configuration went wrong.

### Creating new sources.

This works much like creating new graphs except it is even more likely to not work. More detailed instructions to be added later!
