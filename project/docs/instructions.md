# User instructions

## Getting started

Using the dashboard is easy: when you start up the app, the app loads a dashboard and shows it. The app comes with a demo dashboard, so you don't have to do anything else to enjoy spectacular-looking graphs. But of course, you may want to configure a dashboard of your own.

## Configuring a dashboard

See the instructions below on how to make changes to an existing dashboard, or create a wholly new dashboard altogether.

### Adjusting layout

1. Click the **cog** symbol on the left. A config view opens.
2. Change the x and y dimensions to e.g. 2 and 2.
3. Change the title and timespan if you like.
4. Click **save**.
5. Click the **owl** symbol on the left. The dashboard reloads and shows the new layout and other changes.
